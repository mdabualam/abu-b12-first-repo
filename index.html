    <h1 style="font: bolder; color: tomato;">My First Webpage Design</h1>
    <p style="color: red; font-size: larger;">This time I am committed. Last 5 years I had taken several attempts to be a web developer but failed. It was happened due to distraction for various issues. But this time I have a firm commitment and I would like to complete the course by any means, Insha-Allah!</p>
