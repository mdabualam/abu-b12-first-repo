    <p style="color: red; font-size: larger;">This time I am more strongly committed. Last 5 years I had taken several attempts to be a web developer but failed somehow. It was happened due to distraction for various issues for family and official matters where I was distracted frequently and failed to keep my pace with the course speed. But this time I have a firm commitment and I would like to complete the course by anyhow, Insha-Allah! I seek marcy from Allah to keep continue with the same speed with the course to complete.</p>
